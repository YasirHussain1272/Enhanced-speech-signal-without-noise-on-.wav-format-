Speech enhancement using spectral subtraction is a widely used technique that removes noise from speech signals. It estimates noise spectrum from noisy speech, subtracts it to obtain a clean spectrum, and transforms it back to the time domain. Accurate noise estimation and parameter selection are important for its success.
